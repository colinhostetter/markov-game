    <h1>Markov's Revenge</h1>
    <p><strong>Can you guess which sentence is being written by a human, and which is being written by a computer?</strong></p>
    <div class="play-buttons-container">
      <a href="/game?mode=queue"><button id="stranger-button" class="stranger-button">Play with a stranger</button></a>
      <a href="/game?mode=wait"><button id="friend-button" class="friend-button">Play with a friend</button></a>
    </div>
    <p>It works like this:</p>
    <ul class="instructions">
      <li>You'll play with a partner. Each round, one of you is the writer, and the other is the guesser.</li>
      <li>The writer will be given the beginning of a sentence and have to complete it by choosing words one at a time. Meanwhile, the computer will randomly generate two other sentences.</li>
      <li>Once the sentences are written, the guesser will have to guess which of the three sentences was written by the other player.</li>
      <li>Then, you'll swap roles!</li>
    </ul>
